# Wocabee Bot

I've only tested it in Firefox and Chrome, but it should work in other browsers with their corresponding extensions.

## Installation

### Chrome

1. Download [User JavaScript and CSS extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld).
2. Go to [Wocabee website](https://wocabee.app/).
3. Click on the extension and then on Add new button.
4. Copy and paste the code from [code.js file](code.js) into the JS text area and hit Save.

### Firefox

1. Download [javascript addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript/).
2. Go to [Wocabee website](https://wocabee.app/).
3. Click on the extension, copy and paste the code from [code.js file](code.js) into the window, and then reload the page.

## Usage

When you go to [Wocabee App](https://wocabee.app/app/), and select some package to do, there should be (hopefully) some buttons at the top.

- **Auto Grind** - grind WocaPoints in the "Practice" section (only tasks with 2 WocaPoints)
- **Auto Fail** - fail every 80 tasks to get the most out of bonuses (only when auto-grinding)
- **Auto Focus** - automatically focus the answer box, so instead of needing to click it, you can type right away
- **Solve the current task** - show / input the correct answer (without submitting it)
- **Log Table** - log a simple table with the translations to the console
- **Log JSON** - log the translations to the console, but in a json format
- **Hide** - hide all of the buttons (they will reappear on reload)
